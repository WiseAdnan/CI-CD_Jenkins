# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins for Django Notes App

This project demonstrates a hands-on CI/CD pipeline using **Jenkins**, **Docker**, **DockerHub**, and **Jenkins Shared Libraries** to automate the build and deployment of a Django Notes App.

---

## About the Project :

This pipeline performs the following tasks:

- Clones a Django Notes App from GitHub
- Builds a Docker image using the app's Dockerfile
- Pushes the image to DockerHub
- Deploys the app locally using `docker-compose`

---

##  Forked Repository Used

This pipeline is based on a **forked repository** of a Django Notes App.

- Source code: [https://github.com/WiseAdnan/django-notes-app.git](https://github.com/WiseAdnan/django-notes-app.git)

The original repository has been used only for the app source code.  
A **custom Jenkinsfile** was written from scratch and is included in this repo for the CI/CD pipeline.

---

## Jenkins Shared Library Used

This Jenkins pipeline uses a custom **shared library** containing reusable Groovy scripts for common tasks:

- `clone(branch, id, url)` ‚Äì clones the GitHub repo
- `Build(imageName, tag, dockerhubUser)` ‚Äì builds the Docker image
- `DockerPush(imageName, tag)` ‚Äì pushes the image to DockerHub
